## How to test


When testing the AI Agent Host, you can expect several types of test results depending on the specific aspects you are testing. Here are some common types of test results you might encounter:

1. **Successful deployment**: This result indicates that your Docker Compose configuration successfully deploys and starts all the services defined in your configuration file. It means that the containers are running, and the services are accessible as expected.

2. **Connectivity tests**: These tests verify whether the services within your Docker Compose setup can communicate with each other. They ensure that the networking between the containers is properly configured, and the services can interact as intended.

3. **Functional tests**: These tests assess the functionality of the services running within the Docker Compose setup. For example, if you have a web application container, you might test whether it responds correctly to HTTP requests, processes user input, and produces the expected output. Additionally, you can add the possibility to run notebooks as part of your functional tests. For instance, if your Docker Compose setup includes a Jupyter Notebook, you can design tests that execute specific notebook cells or workflows and verify the expected results. This allows you to validate the functionality of your notebooks and ensure that they produce the desired outcomes when running within the Docker Compose environment. Running notebooks as functional tests can help you ensure the correctness and reliability of your data processing, analysis, or machine learning workflows encapsulated in the notebooks within the Docker Compose environment.

4. **Integration tests**: These tests evaluate how well the different services integrated within your Docker Compose configuration work together. They validate whether the services can cooperate and exchange information or perform complex tasks as expected.

5. **Performance tests**: These tests focus on assessing the performance characteristics of your Docker Compose setup. They might involve measuring response times, throughput, resource utilization, or scalability under different workloads or stress conditions.

6. **Error handling tests**: These tests check how your Docker Compose configuration handles various error scenarios. For example, you might deliberately simulate a service failure and observe if the system gracefully recovers or if error conditions are properly handled.

7. **Security tests**: These tests assess the security posture of your Docker Compose setup. They might involve vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, or checking for misconfigurations that could expose your services to potential threats.

The specific test results you will obtain depend on the test cases you execute and the quality of your Docker Compose configuration. It's important to design and execute a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of your Dockerized application.
