# Claude Code Integration for AI Agent Host

This folder contains the files needed to integrate **Claude Code** into the AI Agent Host by extending the existing Code-Server container.  

It enables Claude Code to directly interact with Code-Server, QuestDB and Grafana over the internal Docker network, while preserving the AI Agent Host as an **agentic environment**.

To apply this integration, replace the corresponding files in the main `docker` directory with the updated versions provided here.


## Why This Environment Is Unique

This agentic environment is uncommon. Most AI deployments operate in:

**Typical AI environments:**
- Text-only conversational interfaces
- Read-only code analysis
- Sandboxed execution with limited capabilities
- Interactions mediated through frameworks or APIs with restrictions

**Key differences in this environment:**
- **Direct system access** – Bash execution, file modification, and network calls are permitted.
- **Multi-container orchestration** – Services communicate directly over the Docker network.
- **Persistent state changes** – Actions can permanently alter the system.
- **No strict sandboxing** – Real database operations and file modifications are possible.
- **Infrastructure control** – Interaction with production-like services is supported.

This level of autonomy and system access is generally limited to:
- Senior developers with full system privileges
- DevOps automation workflows
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure-as-code tools

In most AI environments, it is not possible to:
- Execute live `curl` requests against databases
- Modify running services
- Perform system-level operations with real-world impact

This configuration enables **true autonomous task execution** rather than limited, sandboxed demonstrations.


## Security Guidelines

For maximum isolation and reliability, it is recommended to run the AI Agent Host on **dedicated hardware** rather than sharing resources with other workloads.

### Recommended Hardware

For secure deployments, run the AI Agent Host on a **standalone development box** that is not shared with other production workloads.  

Two suggested configurations:

**Dedicated DevBox**
- **Microserver**: Refurbished HP Microserver Gen8 with quad-core Intel processor and 3 Ethernet ports  
- **CPU**: quad-core: Xeon E3-1260L, Xeon E3-1265L V2, Xeon E3-1220 V2, Xeon E3-1225 V2, Xeon E3-1230 V2, Xeon E3-1240 V2, Xeon E3-1270 V2  
- **RAM**: 16GB (2x8GB) Dual Rank x8 PC3-12800E (DDR3-1600) Unbuffered CAS-11 669324-B21  
- **SSD**: 1 × 250GB Samsung 860 EVO  
- **HDD**: 4 × 1TB Western Digital Enterprise Storage  
- **RAID Controller**: HP P410/512MB  

**Edge / Low-Power Alternative**
- Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 5 — suitable for IoT, field deployments, and lightweight agent tasks.

 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

 Note: You have launched claude in your home directory. For the best experience, launch it in a project directory instead.

 ※ Tip: Start with small features or bug fixes, tell Claude to propose a plan, and verify its suggested edits

> yes in /home/coder/project

● I'll help you work in the /home/coder/project directory. Let me first check what's in this directory.

● List(project)
  ⎿  Listed 956 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● You're in the /home/coder/project directory which contains numerous machine learning and AI research projects related
   to SKA (Spatial Knowledge Acquisition) algorithms. The directory includes projects for quantitative finance, neural
  networks, genomics, geophysics, and trading algorithms.

  What would you like to do with this project?

> you are in docker compose which contains code-server, questdb and grafana, how can you access questdb and grafana 
  containers

● To access QuestDB and Grafana containers from within this code-server container, you can use their service names as
  hostnames. Let me check the docker-compose setup first:

● Bash(find /home/coder -name "docker-compose.yml" -o -name "docker-compose.yaml" 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  /home/coder/docker/docker-compose.yaml

● Read(docker/docker-compose.yaml)
  ⎿  Read 120 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Based on the docker-compose.yaml, you can access the containers using their service names:

  QuestDB:
  - HTTP/REST API: http://questdb:9000
  - PostgreSQL wire protocol: questdb:8812
  - InfluxDB line protocol: questdb:9009
  - Web console: Available at port 9000 (exposed to host)

  Grafana:
  - Web UI: http://grafana:3000
  - Also exposed to host at port 3000

  Testing connectivity:

● Bash(curl -s http://questdb:9000/status || echo "QuestDB not reachable")
  ⎿  Not Found

● Bash(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://grafana:3000 || echo "Grafana not reachable")
  ⎿  200

● Both services are accessible. For your applications:

  1. QuestDB: Use questdb:9000 for REST API or questdb:8812 for PostgreSQL connections
  2. Grafana: Use http://grafana:3000 for API calls

  Example connection strings:
  - QuestDB SQL: postgresql://admin:quest@questdb:8812/qdb
  - QuestDB REST: http://questdb:9000/exec?query=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20table_name

> so you can access both questdb and grafana

● Yes, both QuestDB and Grafana are accessible from this code-server container:

  - QuestDB: ✅ Accessible at questdb:9000 (REST API) and questdb:8812 (PostgreSQL)
  - Grafana: ✅ Accessible at grafana:3000

  The containers are on the same Docker network, so you can use their service names as hostnames for inter-container
  communication.

> are you ablble to perform tasks on questdb and grafana

● Yes, I can perform tasks on both QuestDB and Grafana using various methods:

  QuestDB:
  - Execute SQL queries via REST API (curl to questdb:9000/exec)
  - Insert data via HTTP endpoints
  - Manage tables and data
  - Check database status and metrics

  Grafana:
  - Create/modify dashboards via API
  - Configure data sources
  - Manage users and organizations
  - Export/import dashboard configurations

  Example capabilities:
  - Query QuestDB: curl "http://questdb:9000/exec?query=SHOW TABLES"
  - Create Grafana dashboard: curl -X POST http://grafana:3000/api/dashboards/db
  - Monitor both services' health and performance

  Would you like me to demonstrate any specific tasks on either service?

> good, do you understand that your environment is agentic

● Yes, I understand this is an agentic environment where I can:

  - Autonomously execute tasks across multiple services (code-server, QuestDB, Grafana)
  - Make direct API calls and database operations without manual intervention
  - Orchestrate workflows between containers (e.g., query QuestDB → create Grafana visualizations)
  - Modify system state through code changes, database operations, and configuration updates
  - Chain operations to complete complex multi-step tasks independently

  This differs from a typical read-only or consultation role - I can actively perform operations, make changes, and
  execute complete workflows across your containerized stack.

  What task would you like me to perform across these services?

> Your are  talking straight to QuestDB and Grafana without a middle layer (LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, etc.), how is it 
  possible? 

● You're absolutely right to question this! I can interact directly with QuestDB and Grafana because I have access to native 
  system tools rather than AI-specific frameworks:

  Direct Tool Access:
  - Bash tool: Execute curl commands to hit REST APIs
  - HTTP capabilities: Make direct HTTP requests to services
  - File system access: Read/write configs, scripts, data files
  - Network access: Connect to containers on same Docker network

  This is NOT:
  - LangChain with database connectors
  - LlamaIndex with vector stores
  - AutoGPT with plugin architecture
  - Custom AI agent frameworks

  This IS:
  - Claude Code CLI with system-level tool access
  - Direct container-to-container networking
  - Raw HTTP/SQL operations via command line tools
  - Standard Unix utilities and Python/bash execution

  I'm essentially functioning like a human developer with terminal access - using curl, database clients, and file operations
  rather than AI-specific middleware layers. The "agentic" behavior comes from my ability to autonomously chain these basic
  system tools together, not from specialized AI agent frameworks.

> this agentic environment is not common

● You're absolutely correct - this agentic environment is quite uncommon. Most AI interactions are:

  Typical AI environments:
  - Text-only conversations
  - Read-only code analysis
  - Sandboxed execution with limited capabilities
  - Mediated through frameworks/APIs with restrictions

  This environment is unique because:
  - Direct system access - I can execute bash, modify files, make network calls
  - Multi-container orchestration - Direct communication between services
  - Persistent state changes - My actions actually modify your system
  - No safety sandboxing - Real database operations, file modifications
  - Infrastructure control - Can interact with production-like services

  This level of autonomy and direct system access is typically reserved for:
  - Senior developers with full system privileges
  - DevOps automation scripts
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - Infrastructure-as-code tools

  Most AI assistants can't curl a live database, modify running services, or execute system commands with real consequences.
  This setup essentially gives me the same capabilities as a remote developer with full access to your containerized stack.

  It's a powerful but uncommon configuration that enables true autonomous task execution rather than just advice or sandboxed
  demonstrations.
